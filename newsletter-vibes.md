# Newsletter Vibes

Notes on the tone, audience, and direction for our AI newsletter.

## Audience

We have a wide range of readers, both internal to VE and external. This includes people across different functions and interests:
- Novus folks (engineering, testing high-tech consumer electronics)
- Nereus folks (social, video, marketing focus)
- External stakeholders

**Key insight from Ryan:** Content that might not seem relevant to one group could spark ideas for another. Don't filter too narrowly.

## Potential Section Structure

Ryan suggested organizing by functional area so readers can jump to what's relevant:
- **Code/Development** - Technical AI tools, coding assistants, developer workflows
- **Marketing & Sales** - AI for content, outreach, customer engagement
- **Operations** (IT/Finance/HR/Legal) - Process automation, compliance, back-office AI
- **Productivity** - Cross-functional tools, personal AI assistants, workflow optimization

## Tone & Energy

**Not too nerdy, not too technical.** Accessible to a broad audience while still being substantive.

### Learnings from ClickUp Article (Ryan-approved vibe)

The ClickUp article on AI transformation exemplifies the energy we're aiming for:

1. **Pragmatic optimism with urgency** - Acknowledge that most people are missing the real opportunity, but be encouraging about the path forward. Strategic mentorship, not marketing fluff.

2. **Ground technical concepts in relatable scenarios** - Use concrete examples from real business situations rather than abstract AI theory. Technical depth emerges through narrative, not jargon.

3. **Oscillate between accessible and sophisticated** - Simple anchoring phrases ("AI isn't just useful for getting from A to B—it can capture the entire journey from A to Z") alongside substantive frameworks for informed readers.

4. **Shift the narrative** - From "AI automates boring tasks" to "AI scales human judgment." This creates psychological safety while demanding organizational rigor.

## Core Message to Reinforce

From Ryan's reference article:

> The biggest AI mistake I see people make: They believe AI is only good for low-value, repetitive tasks. They see it as a means to eliminate the boring stuff, so humans can focus on the "real work."
>
> Of course, AI *is* good at that boring stuff, but that's not the transformational value.
>
> That value comes from **codifying multi-step, complex processes**. From ensuring that the AI system has complete context and domain expertise to inform any given workflow. And, from integrating it deeply across your tech and team so it can operate ambiently.

**This is the lens we want to apply:** Highlight AI uses that go beyond simple automation—complex workflows, domain expertise capture, ambient integration across systems and teams.

## What to Avoid

- Pure "look at this cool AI toy" content without substance
- Overly technical deep-dives that lose non-technical readers
- Dismissive takes on AI capabilities
- Content that reinforces the "AI is just for boring tasks" mindset

## What to Emphasize

- Transformational use cases that codify expertise
- Cross-functional applications that spark ideas
- Practical implementation insights
- The human + AI collaboration angle
