# Migration Completion Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Phase 1a: Supabase Migration - COMPLETE
- ✅ **Data Migration**: Successfully migrated 39 feeds, 60 episodes, and 11 digests from SQLite to Supabase
- ✅ **RLS Security**: Enabled Row Level Security with proper service role and authenticated user policies
- ✅ **Web UI Fix**: Fixed datetime subscript error in topics page (`ep.published_date.isoformat()`)
- ✅ **Pipeline Modularization**: Created individual phase subcommands:
  - `run_discovery.py` - RSS discovery phase
  - `run_audio.py` - Audio processing phase
  - `run_scoring.py` - Content scoring phase
  - `run_digest.py` - Digest generation phase
  - `run_tts.py` - TTS audio generation phase

### Infrastructure
- ✅ **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL fully operational with all historical data
- ✅ **Repository Pattern**: Complete SQLAlchemy repositories for Feed, Episode, and Digest
- ✅ **Security**: RLS policies configured for production security best practices

## 🎯 Current Status

**Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with 39 feeds, 60 episodes, 11 digests
**Pipeline**: Fully modular with individual phase scripts
**Web UI**: Functional with datetime issues resolved
**Security**: Production-ready with RLS enabled

## 📋 Next Steps (Phase 1 Continuation)

Based on `move-online.md`, the remaining Phase 1 tasks are:

### Immediate (Phase 1 Completion)
1. **Pipeline Flags**: Add `--from-step` and `--to-step` for granular control
2. **Testing**: Add pytest integration tests for each phase
3. **Storage Strategy**: Begin Phase 2 work on artifact management

### Phase 2: Storage and Artifact Strategy
- GitHub Releases for MP3 storage
- Supabase database backups
- Log management with 7-day retention
- RSS generation and Vercel deployment

### Phase 3: CI/CD Setup
- GitHub Actions for daily pipeline execution
- Automated testing and deployment
- Secret management

### Phase 4: Web UI Hosting
- Deploy web UI to Vercel
- DNS configuration for podcast.paulrbrown.org
- Production authentication
